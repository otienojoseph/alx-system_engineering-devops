# 0x14. MySQL

### Tasks

**0. Install MySQL**
First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.    
    - MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x  
    - Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status 
    - Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.

Example:
```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --versionmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapperubuntu@229-web-01:~$ 
```
**1. Let us in!**
In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

    - Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
    - Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
    - In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status

Example:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'holberton_user'@'localhost'"
Enter password:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for holberton_user@localhost                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost' |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```
